Hii, everyone so as you see we've uploaded the already finished EDA task.. now we have to improve the accuracy by applying different methods and you can also come up with your add on's.
download the data from link:- https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohaiminul101/car-price-prediction/input
Note : For our purpose currently, all code pushes to remote should be done to the 'development' branch. 
The 'main' branch on remote will only have boilerplate code or code ready for production, no other code should be pushed yet to the master branch on remote.
use development branch for experiment and create your own branch in local repo, this repo will mainly consist of these three branches:
predevelopment:-for add on's on EDA
development:-branch you will be working on for model implementation
main:-dont use it
